There are total of three tables in the database: Customer - which contain clients name/address/phonenumber, Task - name, and CustomerTask. CustomerTask is a table that represents a many-to-many relationship between customers and tasks, where a customer can have multiple tasks and a task can be assigned to multiple customers

On the left table you can see the list of customers registered in the database and when you select one you can see what task they requested in the right table. You can also add in new customers by adding their name and afterwards even delete them from the list as well.
